Once upon a time there was a young lad named Spongebob.
Spongebob lived in a pineapple under the sea in a town called Bikini Bottom.
Spongebob is a rather peculiar citizen of Bikini Bottom. 
Unlike most residence, who are fish or other sea creatures, Spongebob, as his suggests, is a literal kitchen sponge. Imagine that.
Surprisingly, SpongeBob doesn't put himself to use to clean dishes, but instead he works at a rather mediocre "restaurant" called the Krusty Krab,
where he single handedly serves up the town's must beloved hamburger: the Krabby patty. SpongeBob's story is full of interesting conflicts involving many memorable allies and several somewhat disappointing foes.

One of SpongeBob's allies is his best friend, Patrick. Patrick is a starfish with less-than-stellar wit.
He is a frequent patron of the Krusty Krab, where the two friends' antics drive Spongebob's coworker, Squidward, up the wall.
Squidward dreams of a day when he can leave his minumum wage cashier job and become a full time painter/clarinetist.
However, the citizens of Bikini Bottom all know that these dreams will almost certainly never come true, though none of them have the heart to tell him so.
